# How to contribute to Blockbench

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD)

If you are contributing to Blockbench in any way, you must adhere to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD).

## Issues and Feedback

To submit a suggestion or report a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench/issues/new).


## Text and Localization

Localizations are handled on an external platform.
If you want to contribute Blockbench translations, you can visit [blockbench.net/translations](https://blockbench.net/translations/). Thank you!


## Source code contributions

Blockbench, the program itself, is mostly just coded by me. But sometimes, code contributions can be helpful!

If you want to contribute to the Blockbench code, please contact me (@Jannis) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sGkj78W) (e.g. in #bb-feedback) *before* to discuss whether a change is necessary in the base program and how it can be approached.
Some changes make sense in Blockbench itself, while others could work better as a plugin.

Minor fixes should be targeting the `patch` branch, new features and fixes that require additional testing should generally target the `next` branch.

By contributing to the Blockbench source, you agree that the changes are in accordance with the applicable [GPL-3.0 license](LICENSE.MD).
