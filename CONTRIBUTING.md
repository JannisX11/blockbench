## Source code contributions

Blockbench, the program itself, is mostly just coded by me. But sometimes, code contributions can be helpful!

If you want to contribute to the Blockbench code, please contact me (@Jannis) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sGkj78W) *before* to discuss whether a change is necessary and how it can be approached.
Some changes make sense in Blockbench itself, while others could work better as a plugin.
