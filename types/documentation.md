Welcome to the reference documentation for Blockbench!

This documentation is automatically generated from the comments and typescript types of the latest Blockbench release.

The documentation is mainly intended for plugin creators. You can find guides on how to get started with plugin development on the Blockbench wiki: [Creating a Plugin - Blockbench Wiki](https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/docs/plugin)

### Navigation

The documentation in the sidebar is divided into two categories: `custom` and `generated`. This separation is mostly irrelevant when reading types, it just stems from the fact that some code is written directly in Typescript, while other code is still written in Javascript with custom types. In some cases, there may be duplicated references between the two, in that case you can usually reference the one in `custom`.

You should be able to find any class and variable via the search function.
