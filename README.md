# Blockbench

Blockbench is a free, modern model editor for low-poly and boxy models with pixel art textures.
Models can be exported into standardized formats, to be shared, rendered, 3D-printed, or used in game engines. There are also multiple dedicated formats for Minecraft Java and Bedrock Edition with format-specific features. 

Blockbench features a modern and intuitive UI, plugin support and innovative features. It is the industry standard for creating custom 3D models for the Minecraft Marketplace.
